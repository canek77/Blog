<!-- dcterms:abstract = This is simple but robust holder for my secondary keyboard (used to control the camera server or install jobs). The keyboard is to be held at 30° angle from edge of desk (in my case, the ingenious IKEA Lack). Screw the holders with four 4 mm screws to bottom of desk. The OpenSCAD model is fairly parametric to allow for accommodation of keyboards of various sizes. -->
