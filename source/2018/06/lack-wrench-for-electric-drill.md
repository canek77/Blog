<!-- dcterms:abstract = IKEA Lack side tables are favorites of makers worldwide, because they're cheap, readily available and easily hackable. People are making everything from them - from server racks to 3D printer enclosures. But the Lack has one downside - the double-pronged screws have to be rightened manually, as no standard tool will fit them. Not anymore - I created the Lack Wrench. 3D printed tool you can attach do electric drill and use it to tighten the Lack legs. -->
