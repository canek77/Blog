<!-- dcterms:abstract = QR Code generator for OpenSCAD This project can generate OpenSCAD source code for a QR code encoding given value. There are already two projects on Thingiverse, but the first does not work properly and the second requires running executable on your machine. So I created third one. How it works This project works completely online in JavaScript. Go to https://ridercz.github.io/OpenSCAD-QR/ and enter the value of your code. The page will generate image of your code (so you can check it's working) and also OpenSCAD code, which will create array with 0 and 1, representing the code. Also provided is simple OpenSCAD module (method) qr_render for drawing the encoded QR Code with given parameters: module_size - the size of single square, default 1x1 mm height - extrusion height, default 1 mm The resulting code is not intended to be used 'as is', you are supposed to incorporate it to your own models. For example see the QR Code Dog Tag Acknowledgements The heavy lifting - QR Code generation itself - was done by the perfect qrcode-generator by Kazuhiko Arase. I just added OpenSCAD code generation and simple web interface. -->
