<!-- dcterms:title = DSO 138 Case With Stand -->
<!-- x4w:alternateUrl = https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2365063 -->
<!-- dcterms:abstract = I remixed the case for DSO 138 oscilloscope. The main changes include adding a slanted stand and back plane to the original model. Everything is held together with six 2.2 x 9.5 mm screws - two to add the stand to the backplane and four to hold backplane, PCB and front part together. -->
